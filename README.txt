About the Project

> In the project we have created a tree and trying to find parent, child, sibling and address of the given node.

> We have made the copy of the tree and showed that while deleting / modifying the original tree copied tree is not affected.

> The code provides the implementations of the following tree traversals:
* In-order
* Pre-order
* Post-order
